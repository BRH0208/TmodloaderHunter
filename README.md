# TmodloaderHunter
The hunter is a new town-style NPC for modded terraria worlds. He sells weapons which are extra-potent against specific creatures. 
These weapons function similarly to the Goblin Tinkerer's prefix, directly modifying the statistics of the weapons. It makes all weapons do 1/4 the damage
In addition, When one of these weapons hits a target of the specific class, it does 6x the damage. The weapons do extra against:
Slime, Undead, Flying Creatures, Swimming Creatures, Hell Creatures, Corruption/Crimson, Blood Moon Creatures, Snow Creatures, Pirates, Jungle Creatures, Hollow Creatures or Solar Eclipse Creatures
There is also net arrows, crafted from a bug net and 50 arrows(Produced in batches of 50). These net arrows knock flying creatures out of the sky
None of the weapons work against bosses.
